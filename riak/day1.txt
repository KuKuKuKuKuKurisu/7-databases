== Do ==
 1) Using PUT, update animals/polly to have a Link pointing to photos/polly.jpg
curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8091/buckets/animals/keys/polly?returnbody=true \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -H "Link: </buckets/photos/keys/polly.png>; riaktag=\"photo\"" \
  -d '{"nickname" : "Sweet Polly Purebreed", "breed" : "Purebred"}'

 2) POST a file of a MIME type we haven't yet used (such as application/pdf)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8091/buckets/photos/keys/riak_cli.pdf \
  -H "Content-type: applicaton/pdf" \
  --data-binary @riak_cli.pdf

3) Create a new bucket called medicines, PUT a jpeg image with proper MIME type keyed
   with 'antibiotics', and link to the animal Ace.

curl -ivX PUT http://localhost:8091/buckets/medicines/keys/antibiotics \
  -H "Content-type: image/jpeg" \
  -H "Link: </buckets/animals/keys/ace>; riaktag=\"prescribed\"" \
  --data-binary @antibiotics.jpg
