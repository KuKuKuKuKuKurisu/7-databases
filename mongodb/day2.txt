1. implement a finalize method to output the count as the total
(This is a very silly and badly worded exercise I think!)

load('distinct_digits.js')
load('map_1.js')
load('reduce_1.js')
load('finalize.js')
db.runCommand({mapReduce: 'phones', map: map, reduce: reduce, finalize: finalize, out: {inline:1}})
