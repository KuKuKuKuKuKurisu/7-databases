If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/couchdb/1.2.0/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.couchdb.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the org.apache.couchdb.plist loaded:
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.couchdb.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/couchdb/1.2.0/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.couchdb.plist

Alternatively, automatically run on startup as a daemon with:
    sudo launchctl list org.apache.couchdb >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
      sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist
    sudo cp /usr/local/Cellar/couchdb/1.2.0/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist

Or start manually as the current user with:
    couchdb
